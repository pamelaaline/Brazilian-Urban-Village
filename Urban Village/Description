Urban Ecovillage Project #1
 
Main goal
Our objective is to transform a 1.58 hectare plot of land, located in the city of Cuiabá-MT, Brazil (in the geodesic center of South America), into an urban ecovillage that, in addition to being built on the pillars of sustainable bioconstruction and the preservation of native vegetation, also provides a source of income for the residents, so that this profitability is compatible with our values ​​and our vision of the world.
 
The land
The land is approximately 100 meters wide (front) by 158 meters long (side), and is located in a region that has been trying to regularize it by ranchers for approximately 20 years. The neighborhood was finally legally recognized by the city hall, and land tenure regularization is in process. However, there is a precarious situation in the provision of basic public services (such as energy, sewage treatment, water, etc.).

What we want to do?
We will use most of the land as an urban ecovillage for the residents, using as many bio-sustainable technologies as possible.
In addition, we will preserve a forest with native vegetation present on the land, which has a total of 3,574.7m2, which can also be used as a leisure and visitation area, or even part of the residents' land, as long that strict rules of preservation and sustainable coexistence with this vegetation are followed.
In the area at the front of the land, which faces the unpaved street, we want to reserve for the creation of a cultural/commercial space, which will be able to provide income in different ways for the residents of the village.

 
How society benefit from it?
We intend to serve as a model of bioconstruction for the state, which simply does not have anything of the kind, in addition to making all stages of the project, videos, timeline, and much more available in an accessible and transparent way, with the intention that more initiatives such as that are carried out in the city and state.
Considering both the region itself and several other regions in the city where the State and the Private Initiative are not present, we understand that offering this possibility to communities can significantly increase their quality of life. In addition, we can promote educational events for the dissemination of construction methods and the possibilities brought by initiatives aimed at sustainability (such as collective efforts within the ecovillage, visitation dates, activities with schools, etc).
In summary, we aim to provide:
-A sustainable building model;
-Production of materials, videos and manuals for bioconstruction in language accessible to the community;
-Promotion of educational events for the dissemination of construction methods and environmental education.

How much have we spent?
Considering only these expenses (not counting gasoline, work and time spent on research, efforts, meetings):
* 285,000 BRL - value of the land purchase;
*1,800 BRL - concierge;
*1,400 BRL cleaning;
*355 BRL - tools, chain, padlock;
* 2,500 BRL - Topographic study.
Total expenditure: around 291,055 BRL, which is equivalent to approximately 57,000 dollars.
 
How much will we still need to spend?
 
Unfortunately a lot! As we've been on the project for a short time, a lot still needs to be done, and we no longer have the money to follow through on the plans. Our priorities at the moment are: the urban and architectural project, an ecological wall, a sewage system or ecological cesspool, and at least one construction for common use, mainly to gather and keep the necessary tools for the maintenance of the land and for the constructions. In view of this, what we ask at this first moment is an approximate value of 50,000 dollars, which will allow us to at least start the execution of our dream.
